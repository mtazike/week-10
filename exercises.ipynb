    "Update the script to train a **Decision Tree Regressor** model that predicts `rating` based on *both* `100g_USD` and `roast`, and saves the trained model as `model_2.pickle`. Notice that the `roast` column is categorical, so you'll need to convert it into a numerical label format:\n",

If a `roast` value is not one of the roast values in the training data, the function should only use the `100g_USD` value to make the prediction (recall `model_1.pickle`). Otherwise, it should use both features."
